# Neural Network
A Neural Network written in C. 

## How it Works: 
A neuron is the simplest piece of a neural network. Add some of these neurons together with some weights and biases and I get a layer, add the layers and I get a network. ... something something ... ML ... I wrote this neural network for processing the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset.

## Run it! 
```

## Why? 
I saw a YouTube video on building a neural network from scratch in C. I also saw one for writing a neural network from scratch in Python. I am also taking Linear Algebra next semester so I figured I might as well learn something about matrices and stuff like that.
